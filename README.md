# LungHistopath-CancerClassifier
A deep learning model for classifying lung cancer types using histopathological images.

## Project Overview
This repository contains a deep learning model for classifying lung cancer types using histopathological images. The project aims to assist in the accurate and automated diagnosis of lung cancer from image datasets.

## Features
- Utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image classification.
- Includes data preprocessing and augmentation techniques.
- Implements three different model architectures for comparative analysis.
- Offers detailed evaluation metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score).

## Dataset
The project uses a dataset of histopathological images specific to lung and colon cancer. This dataset can be accessed from Kaggle at the following URL: [Lung and Colon Cancer Histopathological Images](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/lung-and-colon-cancer-histopathological-images).

## Models
The model leverages CNN architectures, optimized for histopathological image analysis. It includes layers for feature extraction and classification, alongside techniques like dropout for regularization.

## Requirements
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
